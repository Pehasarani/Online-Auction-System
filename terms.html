<br>
“Contract Sale Program Terms” shall mean those terms set forth on Schedule A that govern Contract Sale Agreements. In the event of any conflict between the terms in this Agreement for Listings and the Contract Sale Program Terms, the provisions in the Contract Sale Program Terms will control as to Contract Sale Listings and Contract Sale Agreements.
<br>
A “Completed Purchase” occurs when (i) you have provided to the seller of the Inventory (“Seller”) all of the purchase information requested in the Notification (as defined in 4.2.2) in the manner specified in such Notification to complete your purchase and (ii) the purchase price for the Inventory (the “Purchase Price”) has been received as specified in the Notification.
<br>
“Extended Listing” shall mean any listing where the time to accept bids is extended, one or more times, due to a bid being placed within the final 0-10 minutes of the listing. Each extension is for a period of 1-10 minutes.
<br>
“Installment” shall mean one of multiple purchase and shipment transactions pursuant to a Contract Sale Agreement.
<br>
“Listing Data” shall mean the content on the Platform associated with particular Inventory, including, but not limited to, the description and quantity of the Inventory. COCOBID and Seller shall have the right to modify or correct any Listing Data at any time and such modification shall be binding on any purchase of any Inventory made as a result of a bid placed after such modification.
<br>

<br>
“Contract Sale Agreement Notification” shall mean the communication from COCOBID to notify you that you have been awarded a Contract Sale Agreement.   In the event of any conflict between the terms of a Winning Bid Notification (as described in Section 4.2.2 below) and a Contract Sale Agreement Notification, the terms in the Contract Sale Agreement Notification will control as to Contract Sale Listings and Contract Sale Agreements.
<br>

<br>
“Promotional Content” shall mean any and all information, materials, or content provided or otherwise made available to you by Seller or its agents in any medium in connection with these Terms of Bidding, including promotional content and Listings displayed on the Platform.
<br><br>
4.2. Listing Process
<br><br>
4.2.1. Inventory. Inventory may consist of customer returns or company stock items, some of which may have been previously shipped. The condition of the Inventory will vary and standard designations regarding a product’s condition will be set forth in the Listing Data. The Inventory is provided to you “as is” for purchase on the Platform. The quantity and/or value of actual Inventory in each lot may vary from the description in the Listing Data. Typically such variance is up to 5 percent (5%) less or greater than as set forth in the Listing Data and may include up to 5 percent (5%) quantity and/or value of more damaged items than designated as “Damaged” in the Listing Data; please see the Seller’s Terms for variance information for a particular Listing. Accessories such as remote controls, cables and instructions may or may not be included.
<br><br>
4.2.2. Listing Process. Inventory will be sold pursuant to the listing process set forth in this Section 4.2 (the “Listing”). If you wish to bid on Inventory, you will be required to enter your bid amount. In order to be eligible for the Listing, your bid must be (i) in an amount equal to or higher than the bid listed as the minimum opening bid and higher than the “current winning bid,” as applicable, (ii) at least one bid increment higher than the current bid as set forth on the bid page and (iii) placed before the scheduled closing time for such Listing (including any additional time added for an Extended Listing). If your bid is the highest bid at the conclusion of a Listing or, if it is tied for the highest bid and was placed before any equivalent bids (the “Winning Bid”) you will be notified by email (the “Notification”) at the email address you provided when you created your COCOBID account (or as subsequently updated by you by following instructions on the Platform) that you are the winning bidder. The Notification will serve as your official proof of purchase and/or official invoice. Any additional formal invoice or proof of purchase outside of the original winning notification may not be available. It is your responsibility to keep your email address current and to timely check your email to determine if you are the winning bidder for any Listing in which you participated. Neither COCOBID nor Seller is responsible for the failure of a Notification to reach a winning bidder for any reason, including, but not limited to, technical problems or other system error. See Contract Sale Program Terms for information about Contract Sale Listings and Contract Sale Agreements.
<br><br>
4.2.3. Winning Bids. If your bid is deemed the Winning Bid at the end of the Listing for certain Inventory, you agree to promptly purchase such Inventory by paying the full amount of the Purchase Price and any other applicable fees via one of the payment methods outlined in the Winning Bid Notification, within 2 business days after the end of the Listing or such other period of time as set forth in Seller’s Terms. If you fail to register a Completed Purchase, including by failing to pay in full the Purchase Price and any other applicable fees, within two (2) business days of when the Notification is sent by COCOBID or Seller, as applicable, you shall forfeit any right to purchase such Inventory, and COCOBID may deactivate your account such that you can no longer access the Platform and, at its sole discretion, may choose to (i) offer to sell such Inventory to the next highest bidder or (ii) post such Inventory on the Platform for sale in a new Listing. You shall be responsible for all taxes, shipping costs and any other expenses incurred in connection with your purchase hereunder. See Contract Sale Program Terms for information about Contract Sale Agreement Notifications for Contract Sale Agreements.
<br><br>
If the Listing provides for the Seller to collect the Purchase Price (“Seller-Collect Listing”), then the following additional terms apply: (1) payment of the Purchase Price and Fees will require you to initiate two separate payments: one to Seller for the Purchase Price, and another to COCOBID for any applicable fees owed to COCOBID; (2) your payment method used for your initial payment of COCOBID fees on Seller-Collect Listings will be automatically saved by COCOBID’s payment processor and will be automatically charged/debited for subsequent payment obligations to COCOBID pursuant to Seller-Collect Listings.
<br>
In the event  you either failed to pay in full for any given Winning Bid or violated these or a Seller’s Terms, you may be subject to additional fees or have your account suspended or deactivated.
<br>
See Contract Sale Program Terms for more information about late payments in connection with Contract Sale Agreements.
<br><br>
4.2.4. Deactivation; Cancellation. COCOBID reserves the right, in its sole discretion at any time and for any reason, to deactivate your account, reject any offer to purchase Inventory or suspend or cancel any Listing or purchase of Inventory, including fulfillment of a purchase after completion of a Listing and payment for the Inventory.
<br><br>
4.2.5. Inspection; Acceptance. You shall have 5 business days  (unless a different period of time is agreed by the Seller), excluding weekends and holidays, from the date you take possession of Inventory (the “Inspection Period”) to inspect the Inventory for any discrepancies with the description of the Inventory contained in the Listing, and to report any discrepancies to COCOBID. To report a discrepancy, you must click on the “REPORT AN ISSUE” button next to the respective order in your account and submit the associated form (a Discrepancy Report”). COCOBID will determine if the issue qualifies for resolution and thereafter forward all relevant information to the Seller and attempt to facilitate a resolution. The Seller shall have the right to conduct an additional inspection at its own expense. If Seller agrees that there was a discrepancy, Seller will work with you and/or a COCOBID mediator to reach an amicable resolution, which may include a reimbursement of some or all of the Winning Bid Amount. Any such reimbursement may be in the form of a credit to your COCOBID account. If Seller does not agree that there was a discrepancy, or you and the Seller cannot agree on an amicable resolution, the dispute will be settled in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions set forth below in Section 10 . If you have taken possession of Inventory and do not submit a valid Discrepancy Report  within the Inspection Period you shall be deemed to have made an unqualified acceptance of the Inventory, and you waive all claims with respect thereto. All sales are final.
<br><br>
4.3. Conditions to Sale; Payment; Shipping
<br><br>
4.3.1. Canceled Bids and Purchases. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any bid or purchase for any reason. By way of example, but not limitation, we may cancel your bid or purchase if there are inaccuracies or errors in product or bid information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. While Sellers strive to provide accurate product and bid information, typographical or system errors may occur. In the event that there are bids for incorrectly listed or described Inventory, we shall have the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any purchases placed for such Inventory. In the event that we must cancel a bid or purchase, we will notify you by email of such cancellation.
<br><br>
4.3.2. Payment Terms. You are responsible for paying all fees that you owe to COCOBID or Sellers (See 4.2.3). You are also solely responsible for collecting and/or paying any applicable taxes for any purchases or sales you make through our Services. In the event the Platform offers tools or suggestions to assist with the calculation of any value-added tax or VAT, COCOBID makes no guarantee, representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any such amount, and it is solely your responsibility to determine the appropriate tax. Some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g. Goods and Services Tax (GST), but we will just refer to VAT, GST, and any local sales taxes collectively as “VAT.”
<br><br>
COCOBID may require you to add a payment method (Credit Cards, ACH in USA, BACS in the UK, EFT in Canada, and SEPA in the EU) to your COCOBID account that can be used for paying the Purchase Price, taxes, storage fees, service fees and termination fees described in 4.2.3. The payment method associated with your COCOBID account can be used for any marketplace powered by COCOBID unless the Sellers or COCOBID has restricted the ability to use certain payment methods for certain transactions, as will be set forth in the Listing Data and/or Notification. See link here for complete list of marketplaces powered by COCOBID.
You shall submit the Purchase Price and any other associated fees in accordance with the payment terms set forth in the Listing Data, Notification and on the Platform. The Seller or COCOBID (as applicable) may revise the payment terms from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion upon notice to you, which notice may be via the Listing Data and/or the Notification.
<br>
Your transaction may be eligible for payment via a virtual collection bank account(s) owned by Payoneer and allocated to COCOBID. When the payments are made to the virtual bank accounts owned by Payoneer, COCOBID shall act as a technical service provider delivering Payoneer with the necessary data for the allocation of funds to Sellers. Payment will be required in cleared funds before a Seller ships any Inventory to you.
<br>
If you choose to use your bank account(s) as your Payment Method (“ACH Payment Method”), you hereby authorize COCOBID to debit your banking details via the ACH system while this authorization remains in effect. You may be asked to add your bank account details via a third party service to verify your bank account. COCOBID uses Plaid Technologies, Inc. (”Plaid”) to verify your bank account(s) and periodically confirm your bank account balance prior to approving a transaction. COCOBID shares your information with Plaid in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Information shared with Plaid is treated by Plaid in accordance with its Privacy Policy, available at https://plaid.com/legal/Privacy Policy.
<br>
If you choose to use the ACH Payment Method, a verification process may include debiting a small amount from your bank account(s), then immediately crediting the same amount back to your bank account. COCOBID will use this process only to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your bank account(s), except for your use of the Services.
<br>
You hereby authorize COCOBID to initiate debits from the bank account(s) that you enter in the Services in order to pay amounts owed to your recipients in accordance with the instructions you entered and, if necessary, to initiate adjustments for any transactions credited or debited in error. You agree that the payment transactions will be governed by the rules established by NACHA, the Electronic Payments Association, as in effect from time-to-time. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the payment information, or the payment instructions provided to COCOBID.
<br>
You understand that this authorization will remain in effect until you cancel it in writing or revoke it. To cancel an ACH Payment please email payments@bstock.com with the payment details. Cancellation request must be received at least three (3) working days prior to the date you have requested the transaction be processed. Furthermore, you authorize COCOBID to debit, if the payment is returned for any reason, a rejected/returned item fee of $30 or the maximum amount allowed by law. You represent that you have authority to bind the organization that owns the bank account(s), and to authorize all transactions to the bank account(s) that are initiated through COCOBID. You acknowledge that transactions initiated to the bank account(s) must comply with the provisions of U.S. law.
<br>
If the recipient does not deposit or otherwise receive and process the payment within a reasonable amount of time, COCOBID reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to expire, void, or cancel any payment. If we expire, void, or cancel any payment, you authorize us to, and we will, credit the amount of the payment back to the original bank account, less any fees or other amounts owed by you to COCOBID.
<br>You are responsible for verifying the accuracy of payment details and COCOBID will have no liability for losses or damages, including all consequences of non-payment (e.g., reinstatement fees), due to inaccurate payment details.
<br>See Contract Sale Program Terms for more information about payments in connection with Contract Sale Agreements.
<br><br>4.3.3. Shipping. Please refer to our Shipping Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference, for information on the various options available to Sellers for shipping Inventory to Buyers. Buyer acknowledges and agrees to be bound by all such shipping terms set forth in the Shipping Policy. In no event will COCOBID be liable for loss of or damage to Inventory during shipping. Nor will COCOBID have any responsibility for transportation arranged directly by Seller or Buyer. See Contract Sale Program Terms for more information about shipments in connection with Contract Sale Agreements.
<br><br>4.3.4. Identification of Seller. You acknowledge that the information regarding the Purchase Price and any particular sale are confidential to COCOBID and Seller.
<br><br>4.4 Contract Sale Listings and Contract Sale Agreements. If you are the winning bidder for a Contract Sale Listing and awarded a Contract Sale Agreement, the provisions in this Section 4 may be supplemented or superseded by those provisions set forth in the Contract Sale Program Terms and Contract Sale Agreement Terms for any such Contract Sale Listing and Contract Sale Agreement.
<br><br>4.5. Promotional Content Disclaimer
<br>YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER SELLER NOR COCOBID MAKES ANY GUARANTY OF THE ACCURACY, CORRECTNESS OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY PROMOTIONAL CONTENT AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (I) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS ARISING FROM THE USE THEREOF; (II) ANY FAILURES, DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS IN THE DELIVERY OF ANY PROMOTIONAL CONTENT CONTAINED WITH THE PLATFORM; (III) LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE PROMOTIONAL CONTENT PROVIDED BY THE PLATFORM; (IV) ANY CONDUCT BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLATFORM; OR (V) ANY PROMOTIONAL CONTENT OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED THROUGH OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PLATFORM.

<div id="9"><b>9. Violation of These Terms of Use</b>

<br><br>
COCOBID may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Services, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) COCOBID’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Services.

<br>
You agree that COCOBID may, in its sole discretion, without prior notice and to the extent applicable, terminate your access to the Services, deactivate your account and/or block your future access to the Services if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements or guidelines which may be associated with your use of the Services.

You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will cause irreparable harm to COCOBID for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to COCOBID obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that COCOBID deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies COCOBID may have at law or in equity.
<br><br>
</div><div id="10"><b>10. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</b>

<br><br>
Mandatory Mediation. In the event there is any dispute between a Buyer and Seller regarding the quantity, quality, or type of Inventory received, the Buyer and Seller must first attempt to mediate such disputes through COCOBID Mediation. No party to this Agreement can bring legal action against another party to this Agreement without first participating in COCOBID Mediation, unless one party refuses to submit to mediation and legal action is brought to specifically enforce this mandatory mediation provision of this Agreement. If the dispute cannot be resolved at mediation, either party may initiate arbitration as set forth in this Section 10.
<br>

Unless superseded by governing law and dispute resolution provisions set forth in the Seller’s Terms (which may vary on a per-Seller basis), the terms of this Section 10 shall apply as follows:
<br>

These Terms of Use will be construed in accordance with and governed exclusively by the laws of the United States and the State of California applicable to agreements made among California residents and to be performed wholly within such jurisdiction, regardless of such parties’ actual domiciles excluding: (1) its conflicts of law principles; and (2) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or any local laws implementing such convention in any applicable jurisdiction.
<br>
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH COCOBID AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
<br>
You agree that all such disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and COCOBID arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitration.
<br>
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of these Terms of Use and any relevant agreement between the parties as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, or the interpretation of these Terms of Use, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
<br>
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word “arbitrator” in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA’s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under these Terms of Use.
<br>
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”) to all other parties by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if any other party has not provided a postal address, then by electronic mail, with a copy to COCOBID at disputes@bstock.com. The Notice must include a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought. The parties shall thereafter make good faith efforts to resolve the dispute directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, any party may commence an arbitration proceeding. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you may send a copy to COCOBID at disputes@bstock.com. Any settlement offer made by a party, if any, shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
<br>
The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which the initiating party resides or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, any party may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on the parties subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
<br>
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different parties. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
<br>
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Use.
<br>
No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.
<br>
Jurisdiction. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms of Use, to the fullest extent permitted by law you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located in the State of California for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. You also waive your rights to a jury trial.
<br>
Time Limit for Claims. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. You agree to the admissibility of computer records and electronic evidence in any dispute herein.
<br>
Severability of Dispute Resolution; Arbitration. In the event the provisions in this Dispute Resolution Section are held invalid or unenforceable, then this Dispute Resolution Section, in its entirety, will cease to apply, and the parties will not be obligated to arbitrate any disputes.

Headings and the division of these Terms of Use into separate sections, subsections and/or exhibits are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of these Terms of Use.
<br>
These Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by COCOBID constitute the entire agreement between you and COCOBID with regard to your use of the Services; provided, however, that if you have entered into a separate agreement for Services with a Seller, (“Seller’s Terms”), except where expressly provided in these Terms of Use that the Seller’s Terms supersede the provisions of these Terms of Use, the provisions of these Terms of Use will control in the event of any conflict between these Terms of Use and the Seller Terms. COCOBID’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be deemed a waiver by COCOBID of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use. Any such waiver must be in writing in order to be effective.
<br>
Neither COCOBID nor a Seller shall be liable to you for failure or delay in performance hereunder due in whole or in part to an act of God, strike, lockout or other labor dispute, civil commotion, sabotage, fire, flood, explosion, acts of any government, unforeseen shortages or unavailability of fuel, power, transportation, or supplies, and any other causes which are not within COCOBID’s or Seller’s reasonable control, whether or not of the kind specifically enumerated above.

</div><div id="15">
<b>15. Contract Sales Terms of Use</b>
<br><br>
SCHEDULE A: CONTRACT SALE PROGRAM TERMS
<br>
These Contract Sale Program Terms govern Contract Sale Agreements (as defined in the Agreement). In the event of any conflict between the terms in the Agreement for Listings and these Contract Sale Program Terms, the provisions in these Contract Sale Program Terms will control as to Contract Sale Listings and Contract Sale Agreements.
<br>PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE THE WINNER OF A CONTRACT SALE AGREEMENT, YOU ARE BOUND FOR THE ENTIRE CONTRACT SALE AGREEMENT TERM. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO CANCELLATION OR EARLY TERMINATION.
<br><br>
15.1. Notifications
<br><br>
If you are the winner of a Contract Sale Listing and awarded a Contract Sale Agreement, you will receive a Contract Sale Agreement Notification from COCOBID to inform you that you have been awarded the Contract Sale Agreement. The Contract Sale Agreement Notification is separate from the Winning Bid Notification; you will receive a Winning Bid Notification for each Installment of the Contract Sale Agreement with terms regarding the particular Installment. Please note there are no separate Listings for the Installments; you have already won them pursuant to the Contract Sale Agreement.
<br><br>
15.2. Payments
<br><br>
<br>(a) In the event that you win a Contract Sale Listing and awarded a Contract Sale Agreement, you may be required to pay a deposit within 48 hours (or such other period of time as set forth in the Contract Sale Agreement Notification) of COCOBID’s sending of the Contract Sale Agreement Notification. Any required deposit amount will be listed on the Contract Sale Agreement Terms.  If any of the deposit remains in your account when the Contract Sale Agreement has concluded, such funds will be returned to you. If you violate any of these Contract Sale Program Terms, including failure to timely pay any fees when due, you agree to forfeit your deposit at the conclusion of the Contract Sale Agreement. If you fail to timely pay fees due under these Contract Sale Program Terms three or more times during the term of the Contract Sales Agreement, you will be required to place into your COCOBID account a deposit in the amount of at least one Installment’s worth of estimated sales, which amount will be determined in COCOBID’s sole discretion based on the estimated value per lot or the actual value of the Installment (if there is a flat cost per Installment).
<br>
(b) You must pay for each Installment within 1 (one) business day (or such other period of time as set forth in the Contract Sale Agreement Notification) of your receiving a Winning Bid Notification in connection with the particular Installment of the Contract Sale Agreement. Each Installment’s Winning Bid Notification will inform you of the amount due for the Installment. You may utilize different payment methods for the Installments, if specified in the Contract Sale Listing or Contract Sale Agreement.
<br>
(c) If a deposit required above in subsection (a) or any payment for an Installment required in subsection (b) is not received on time, you agree to pre-fund your COCOBID account at least one week prior to any Installment until the Contract Sale Agreement has expired. If you fail to pre-fund your COCOBID account, you authorize COCOBID to charge any payment method on file to fund your COCOBID account.
<br>
(d) You authorize COCOBID to apply your COCOBID balance to any Installments under this Contract Sale program.
<br>
(e) Please note that some Contract Sale Agreements may require particular payment methods or require you to be approved for net payment terms.
<br>
15.3. Installments and Orders
<br>
(b) As the winner of a Contract Sale Agreement:
<br>
(i) you are agreeing to pay for and accept delivery of all Inventory in Installments in accordance with the Contract Sale Agreement Terms stated on the Contract Sale Listing;
<br>
(ii) you authorize COCOBID to assign Inventory for each Installment and create an Installment order for you each time that Inventory is available; and
<br>
(iii) you agree that COCOBID will (A) create a Listing that represents the Inventory in each Installment, (B) set the price of the Installment according to the Contract Sale Agreement Terms, (C) bid on the Installment on the buyer’s behalf, and (D) send to the buyer a Winning Bid Notification.
<br>
(c) Each Installment will be assigned to the shipping address you used in the Contract Sale Listing (unless the shipping address is changed pursuant to Section 4 below).
<br>
(d) Depending on the Contract Sale type, you may be eligible to skip one weekly Installment over the course of the Contract Sale Agreement term with advance notice to COCOBID. If this option is available to you, you will be notified, and given the details about exercising the option, through the applicable Contract Sale Agreement Terms.
<br><br>
15.4. Shipping
<br><br>
(a) The shipping cost for each Installment may match the cost displayed to you during the Contract Sale Listing. The Contract Sale Listing will specify if this is the case.
<br>
(b) If you intend to ship to multiple locations, contact COCOBID in advance for approval and to generate the shipping cost for each location.
<br>
(c) Any change to the shipping address is subject to COCOBID approval and may result in a higher shipping cost than originally provided in the Contract Sale Listing.
<br>
(d) You must have a valid Reseller Certificate on file for each state to which Installments will be shipped. In the event you have provided an address in a state for which you do not have a Reseller Certificate, the Inventory will be shipped to the approved address connected to your account.
<br>
(e) Installments can be shipped to buyer the same day or within one day of payment for the Installment. You must be prepared to accept all shipments as soon as they are made available.
<br>
(f) A Seller may elect to allow you to arrange your own shipping, in which case you will receive a notification informing you of that option, or it will be noted in the Contract Sale Listing.  If buyer-arranged shipping is permitted and you choose that option, then (i) no shipping costs will be charged to you; (ii) you must schedule a recurring pickup time directly with the Seller; and (iii) all Inventory must be picked up within one business day of your receipt of the Winning Bid Notification.
<br>
15.5. Cancellation of Contract Sale Agreements
<br>
The Seller and/or COCOBID reserve the right to cancel your Contract Sale Agreement for any reason or no reason.
<br>
If you cancel a Contract Sale Agreement prior to the expiration of its terms, you agree to pay a cancellation fee in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the GMV for the remainder of the Contract Sale Agreement. For example, if there are 20 Installments remaining on a Contract Sale Agreement when you cancel, the cancellation fee would be the GMV of two Installments. ,/p>
<br>
15.6. Violation of These Contract Sale Program Terms
<br>
If you fail to comply with these Contract Sale Program Terms, COCOBID may: (i) cancel your Contract Sale Agreement; (ii) suspend or terminate your access to the Contract Sale Agreement Listing site; (iii) suspend or terminate your right to bid on Contract Sale Agreement Listings; or (iv) or suspend or terminate your right to bid on the COCOBID platform.
