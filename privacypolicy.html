            <br><br>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>

Cocobid, LLC (“Cocobid,” “us” or “we”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and end users. This Privacy and Cookie Policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect, share and use personal information collected through our corporate websites (including www.bstocksupply.com, www.bstocksupply.eu, and marketplaces within the Cocobid Network) (the “Sites”) and any related Cocobid application, marketplace service or tool (collectively, the “Services”), as well as in connection with our events, sales and marketing activities. “You” or “your” means the individual using the Services and the entity which such individual represents.

If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, then please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this Policy.
<br><br>
<b>ABOUT US</b>
<br>
Cocobid  is headquartered in the United States. We provide online marketplace solutions and related services that enable our customers to more easily buy and sell bulk inventory. Our customers include major retailers, brands, and manufacturers looking to sell inventory (“Sellers”) and customers looking to purchase that inventory (“Buyers”).

For more information about us, please see the “About Us” section of our Site at https://bstock.com/.
<br><br>
<b>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</b><br><br>
The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:
<br><br>
(a) Information you provide us. We may collect personal information you provide to us voluntarily: for example, when you apply to create an account to access the Services, bid on or buy products sold via the Sites, subscribe to marketing communications from us, submit enquires to us and/or otherwise contact us. We may also collect personal information from you offline, such as when you attend one of our events, during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact customer support. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.
<br><br>
<b>The information we collect may include:</b>
<br><br>
Contact and identification information, such as your first and last name, the name of the entity which you represent (if applicable), your email address, phone number, business address, fax number, business resale certificate number, and other customer information, including without limitation, the username and password chosen by you for access to the Services.
Financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers and the address of the bank from which you will be wiring funds for purchases.
Bidding, buying, or selling information you provide during a transaction, or other transaction-based content that you generate or that is connected to your account as a result of a transaction you are involved in.
If you inquire about a career at Cocobid through our Site’s careers page, you will be asked to provide your name, email, phone number, and resume. We utilize a third-party provider, Greenhouse, to host our job applications and assist with the application process. Greenhouse has its own terms of use and privacy policies, and we encourage you to review those policies whenever you visit their website or interact with their platform. Cocobid will use the personal data of job applicants solely for employment evaluation purposes. Providing this information is completely voluntary.
<br>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from users of our Sites under the age of 18 and/or their internet usage, and such persons are not authorized to use the Services. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old. You also represent, by accessing or using the Services, that you are of legal age to enter into legal agreements.
<br><br>
(b) Information we collect automatically. When you visit or use our Services, we automatically collect certain information from your device. In some jurisdictions, including California and countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.
<br>
Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information such as your IP addresses, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Sites, including pages accessed and links clicked.
<br>
This information is primarily used to maintain the security and operation of our Services. Collecting this information also enables us to better understand the users (like you) who come to our Sites, where they come from, and what content on our Sites is of interest to them. We use this information for our internal analytics and reporting purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Services to users.
<br>
Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies, as explained further under the heading “Cookies and Similar Technologies”.
<br>
Information we obtain from third-party sources. From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third-party sources (including lists from tradeshow events that you’ve registered for, and sometimes Sellers will provide Cocobid a list of buyers for their sites), but only where we have some assurances that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.
<br>
The types of information we collect from third parties include your first and last name, the name of the entity which you represent (if applicable), your email address, phone number, business address, fax number, business resale certificate number, and other customer information, and we use the information we receive from these third parties to invite you to access the Services, bid on or buy products sold via the Sites, subscribe to marketing communications from us, submit enquires to us and/or otherwise contact us.
<br>
Social Media. We operate social media pages on third-party networks and have social media icons on our Website. When you visit or link to our social media pages, data is processed both by us and the applicable social media provider. Social media providers are unaffiliated with us, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of social media providers.  Social media providers have their own terms of use and privacy policies, and we encourage you to review those policies whenever you visit their websites or interact with their platforms.
<br><br>
<b>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b><br><br>
We use personal information collected via our Sites for a variety of business purposes described below. If you are from the European Economic Area, we have also described the legal basis for collecting and using the personal information we collect from you.
We normally collect personal information from you where the processing is in our legitimate business interests (“Business Purposes”), in order to enter into or perform a contract with you (“Contractual”), where we have your consent to so (“Consent”), and/or for compliance with our legal obligations (“Legal Reasons”).

We may use the personal information we collect in the following ways:
<br>

<br><br>
<b>HOW WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</b><br><br>
We retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary and relevant for the purposes outlined in the section above. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from further processing. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, we store email addresses until the user requests to be unsubscribed or removes themselves through any self-service tools offered to the user.
<br>
In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts for Legal Reasons, e.g. to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our customer agreements, and take other actions permitted or required by applicable national laws.
<br><br>
<b>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</b><br><br>
We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipient’s parties for the following purposes:
<br>
With Sellers: If you are purchasing inventory through the Services, Cocobid may share such information with the Sellers from whom you bid on or buy products via the Services, as necessary to ensure successful fulfillment of any bids and/or purchases you make via the Services.
<br>
Service Providers: Cocobid may use other companies to perform services on its behalf and which require access to your information to do that work. Examples include hosting data, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, facilitating some aspects of the Services, sending e-mails, fulfilling purchase requests, and providing payment processing services. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your personal information for purposes that are described in this Policy or notified to you when we collect your personal information. In some instances, you may be re-directed to such third party’s site, such as in connection with certain payment processing methods, in which case your data may also be subject to such third party’s privacy policy and terms and conditions; please review all such policies and terms prior to providing them personal information. 
<br>
Cocobid Group Companies: We may share your information with our parent companies, subsidiaries, and/or affiliates for use and processing purposes described in this Policy.
<br>
Special Circumstances: There may be instances when Cocobid may disclose personal information without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of its Sellers, Cocobid, or any of their affiliates, employees, agents, and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law, governmental request, judicial proceeding or other legal process (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).
<br>
Business Transfers: If Cocobid or any Seller sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we may transfer your personal information to a potential buyer (and its agents and advisors) in connection with that transaction.
<br>
Cocobid may obtain your written consent from time to time in electronic form by using online agreements or other acknowledgments on the Services, including for any other contemplated uses of your personal data not addressed in this Privacy Policy. Please read all online agreements carefully before accepting them.  
<br><br>
<b>YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</b><br><br>
(a) We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
<br>
(b) If you are a resident of the European Union, the United Kingdom or another jurisdiction that has adopted laws substantially similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the following data protection rights:
<br>
If you wish to access, correct, update, or request the deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
You have the right to opt out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you.

Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

<br>(c) If you are a resident of California, under the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act effective January 1, 2023 (“CCPA/CPRA”), “consumers” have the right to request:
<br>
The categories of personal information (including sensitive personal information if applicable) we have collected about you;<br>
The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;<br>
The business or commercial purpose of collecting, selling or sharing personal information;<br>

<br>
We do not sell or share personal information for monetary consideration under CCPA/CPRA. Personal data may be provided to our service providers, contractors, and, pursuant to Sections 1798.140(ad)(2)(A) and 1798.140(ah)(2)(A) of the CCPA/CPRA, to third parties.

<b>SECURITY</b><br><br>
We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures designed to protect the security of any personal information in our possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our site is at your own risk.

<br><br>
<b>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</b><br><br>
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
<br>
Specifically, our Site servers are located in the United States and in Germany, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
<br>
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Policy. Such measures include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers, which require all such recipients to protect the personal information that they process from the EEA in accordance with European data protection laws.
<br><br>
<b>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</b><br><br>
